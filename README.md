# Desite Study App

## Description
This is a web application, to test the usablity of the [desite prototype](https://infovis-mannheim.de/apviad/projects/desite/) by comparing it to Google Maps and the Deutsche Bahn Navigator app. The application is used to conduct the study, to flag wrong results and to display charts of the results. It could be used to test other interfaces in the future, but is currently not build in a modular way.

## Tech
UI is written using svelte, results are recieved via an Express server and stored in a Mongo database.
